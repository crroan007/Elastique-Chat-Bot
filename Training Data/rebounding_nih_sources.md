# Rebounding Evidence (NIH-Indexed Sources)

## Key Findings to Train the Bot
- **Thoracic duct flow rises with exercise:** A 2025 *Scientific Reports* study used 18-MHz ultrasound to show the thoracic duct diameter grew from **2.69 ± 1.06 mm (rest) to 3.41 ± 1.32 mm post-exercise** — direct evidence that moderate exercise mechanically boosts lymph flow.

- **Mini-trampoline preconditioning cleared post-dive microbubbles:** In a 2022 trial (*IJERPH*), **15 minutes of mini-trampoline bouncing before SCUBA** reduced vascular gas emboli compared with control, suggesting improved fluid/endothelial clearance from vertical acceleration.

- **Cardio load on a mini-trampoline is higher than flat ground:** Adults doing a stationary running exergame on a mini-trampoline hit higher HR/VO₂ than the same game on the floor (*Gait & Posture* 2019), giving a low-impact way to drive the muscle/venous-lymph pump.

## Bot-Friendly Script Snippets
- "NIH-indexed ultrasound work shows the thoracic duct widens after moderate exercise, so even gentle bouncing pushes more lymph."
- "A mini-trampoline trial cut post-dive microbubbles after just 15 minutes of bouncing, pointing to better fluid clearance from vertical acceleration."
- "If joints are sensitive, use the 2–5 minute 'health bounce' (feet stay on the mat) to get the lymph pump without impact."
