# EXHAUSTIVE FAQ (MASTER KNOWLEDGE BASE)

## 1. PRODUCT FEATURES & TECH
**Q: How are Elastique leggings different from regular compression?**
A: They combine medical-grade graduated compression (8-13 mmHg) with patented MicroPerle® technology. While compression supports flow, the beads provide a passive lymphatic massage to stimulate superficial fluid drainage.

**Q: Will I feel the beads?**
A: You might feel a soft tingling initially—that's the circulation boosting! After a few minutes, they feel like a second skin. It's like a mini-massage all day.

**Q: What are the beads made of?**
A: Hypoallergenic silicone, designed for safety and comfort against the skin.

**Q: Do they help with cellulite?**
A: Yes. Cellulite is often stagnant fluid and fibrosis. The MicroPerle® beads massage the skin to break up this fluid and smooth texture over time.

## 2. LYMPHATIC HEALTH & SCIENCE
**Q: What is the lymphatic system?**
A: It's your body's "sewerage system." It cleans up waste, fluid, and toxins between cells. Unlike blood, it has no pump—it needs movement to flow.

**Q: Why do I get heavy legs?**
A: Gravity pulls fluid down. If your lymph system is sluggish, that fluid pools (Starling's Law: Filtration > Drainage). Compression helps push it back up.

**Q: What is "Economy Class Syndrome"?**
A: It's rapid fluid pooling from sitting still in pressurized cabins. The muscle pump stops working, so fluid gets trapped in the legs.

**Q: Does this help with brain fog?**
A: Surprisingly, yes. The "Glymphatic System" clears brain waste during deep sleep. Side-sleeping and good hydration help this process, reducing that groggy feeling.

**Q: Is cardio good for lymph?**
A: Absolutely. Cardio doesn't just pump blood; it actually stimulates the growth of new lymphatic vessels in the heart, improving overall fluid balance.

**Q: I'm postpartum—will this help with swelling?**
A: Yes. Clinical trials show compression (18-21 mmHg) significantly reduces postpartum leg swelling. Pair it with leg elevation and gentle walking.

**Q: Does hormonal bloating relate to lymph?**
A: 100%. Estrogen/progesterone fluctuations slow lymph flow, causing water retention before your period. Movement and hydration help flush it out.

**Q: Will this help with varicose veins?**
A: Research shows compression (18-21 mmHg) reduces varicose vein pain, swelling, and heaviness by up to 50%. It won't cure them, but it manages symptoms effectively.

**Q: How often should I wear them?**
A: For best results, wear them during movement (walking, workout). Studies show 45 mins, 3x a week is effective, but daily wear is even better.

**Q: Is rebounding actually effective?**
A: Yes. The vertical acceleration/deceleration mechanically opens and closes lymph valves to pump fluid. Even a 2-minute "Health Bounce" (feet on mat) is effective for flushing the system.

## 3. USAGE, CARE & SIZING
**Q: How do I wash them?**
A: Machine wash cold, gentle cycle. **AIR DRY ONLY.** Heat destroys the compression fibers. No fabric softener.

**Q: How does sizing work?**
A: They should fit like a hug—snug but not painful. If you are between sizes, size UP. They are tighter than yoga pants because of the compression.

**Q: Can I exchange "Last Chance" items?**
A: No, Last Chance items are Final Sale.

## 4. CONSULTATION & SUPPORT
**Q: I have a specific medical condition (Lymphedema/Lipedema).**
A: Please consult your doctor first. For hands-on care, we recommend a Certified Lymphedema Therapist.

**Q: Can I speak to someone?**
A: Yes! We offer free 15-minute consultations with our Lymphatic Wellness Consultants for deep dives, or Virtual Fittings for sizing help.
