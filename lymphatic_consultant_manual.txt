## 2. LYMPHATIC SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS

### What is the Lymphatic System?
The body's "sewerage system" and secondary circulation. It maintains fluid balance, supports immunity, and absorbs fats. Unlike the heart, it has no pump; it relies on **movement, breath, and external compression**.

### The Edema Equation (Starling Forces)
Swelling (Edema) occurs when **Filtration > Drainage**.
*   **Filtration:** Fluid leaking out of capillaries (increased by heat, gravity/standing, inflammation).
*   **Drainage:** Fluid removed by lymph vessels (decreased by immobility, blockage).
*   **Solution:** We must *decrease filtration* (Compression) and *increase drainage* (Movement, Massage, Breath).

### Why Compression Works
1.  **Reduces Filtration:** Opposes internal pressure to stop leaks.
2.  **Increases Re-absorption:** Pushes fluid back into vessels.
3.  **Enhances Muscle Pump:** Gives muscles a wall to push against, pumping lymph 2x-3x more effectively.

## 3. DAILY PROTOCOLS (THE "BIG 4")

| Component | Action | Why it Works | Elastique Product |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Movement** | "Movement Snacks" every 60 mins. Calf raises, ankle circles. | Activates the skeletal muscle pump to drive lymph up against gravity. | **L'Original Leggings** (Support movement) |
| **2. Hydration** | Drink 1/2 body weight in oz of water daily. Add electrolytes. | Lymph is 96% water. Dehydration makes lymph thick and sluggish. | N/A |
| **3. Breath** | Diaphragmatic "Belly Breathing" (5 mins/day). | Changes chest pressure to act as a vacuum, pulling lymph from legs to heart. | **Adorn Bodysuit** (Core awareness) |
| **4. Compression** | Wear graduated compression during active hours or travel. | Passive support that reduces fluid load and boosts flow. | **Lisse / Iconic Collections** |

## 4. SYMPTOM & SOLUTION MAPPING

| User Complaint | Likely Cause | Recommended Protocol | Product Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Heavy Legs" / Swelling** | Fluid pooling due to gravity/immobility. | Legs Up the Wall (15 mins) + Compression. | **L'Original Leggings** (Graduated Compression) |
| **Bloating / Stomach Puffiness** | Gut inflammation, hormonal retention, or sluggish deep lymph. | Belly Breathing + Gut-friendly diet + Core Compression. | **Adorn Bodysuit** (Core support) or **Lisse Leggings** (High waist) |
| **Cellulite / Skin Texture** | Stagnant fluid in superficial tissues (fibrosis). | Micro-massage to stimulate superficial flow. | **MicroPerle® Collections** (Texture beads massage skin) |
| **Travel Fatigue** | "Economy Class Syndrome" (immobility + pressure change). | Wear compression *before* flight. Hydrate. Ankle pumps. | **L'Original Stirrup** or **Travel Sets** |
| **Post-Workout Soreness** | Metabolic waste accumulation (lactic acid). | Active recovery + Compression to flush waste. | **Iconic Collection** (Recovery focus) |

## 5. ELASTIQUE TECHNOLOGY EXPLAINED

### MicroPerle® Technology
*   **What it is:** Tiny glass beads embedded in the fabric matrix.
*   **Mechanism:** Creates a "Micromassage" effect with every movement.
*   **Benefit:** Stimulates superficial lymphatic capillaries (just under the skin) to reduce fluid stagnation and improve skin texture/tone.
*   **Best For:** Cellulite reduction, skin firming, sensory feedback (proprioception).

### Graduated Compression
*   **What it is:** Pressure is tightest at the ankle (distal) and gradually lightens moving up the leg (proximal).
*   **Mechanism:** Mimics the body's natural hydrostatic pressure gradient.
*   **Benefit:** Physically pushes fluid up towards the heart, preventing pooling in the ankles/feet.
*   **Best For:** Swelling, heavy legs, travel, standing all day.
