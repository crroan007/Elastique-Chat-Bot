# Master Research & Citation Table

**Purpose:** This table serves as the "Brain" for the bot's scientific authority AND its "Driver" logic. It tells the bot what to ask next and how to build the protocol.

| **Deep Breathing / Belly Fat** | Cisterna Chyli (abdominal reservoir) is pumped by deep breathing. | "The Cisterna Chyli acts as a reservoir in your abdomen that is pumped by deep breathing." | "Do you tend to breathe into your chest or your belly?<br>Have you ever tried diaphragmatic breathing?" | **Add to Morning Protocol:**<br>5 mins Diaphragmatic Breathing (supine). | [View Study](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00375.2022) |
| **Sinus / Brain Fluid** | Nasopharyngeal plexus drains CSF to cervical nodes. | "New research identifies the nasopharyngeal plexus as a key drainage point for brain fluid." | "Do you suffer from sinus congestion or morning puffiness?<br>Do you clench your jaw at night?" | **Add to Morning Protocol:**<br>Gentle neck massage + warm compress. | [View Study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06899-4) |
| **Cellulite / Skin Texture** | 3 months of micromassage = **56% reduction** in skin irregularity. | "Clinical studies showed a 56% reduction in skin irregularity after 3 months of consistent micromassage." | "Is skin texture/cellulite a main concern for you?<br>Where do you notice it most (thighs, glutes)?" | **Add to Daily Protocol:**<br>Evening: 10 mins Micromassage (or dry brushing) on target areas. | [View Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11201858/) |
| **MLD / Manual Therapy** | MLD is effective for fluid redirection and pain relief. | "MLD is clinically proven to support fluid redirection and pain relief." | "Have you ever had a professional lymphatic massage?<br>Would you like me to check for a therapist in your city?" | **Action:** Trigger Provider Search (Geo-match).<br>**Upsell:** "Our consultants can also guide you." | [View Study](https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/bjcn.2024.0101) |
| **Red Light Therapy** | Red light reduces volume and pain in lymphedema. | "Systematic reviews suggest red light therapy can help reduce volume and pain in lymphedema." | "Do you have access to a red light panel or sauna?<br>Are you dealing with any specific pain points?" | **Add to Weekly Protocol:**<br>3-4x/week: 10-20 mins Red Light Therapy. | [View Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10103-023-03959-z) |
| **Flying / Leg Swelling** | Light compression (8-15 mmHg) reduces swelling by 50%. | "Research on flight attendants showed that even light compression (8-15 mmHg) reduced swelling by 50%." | "Do you travel often for work or pleasure?<br>Do your ankles get puffy after long flights?" | **Add to Travel Protocol:**<br>Wear Elastique leggings for all flights >2 hours.<br>Hydrate + Ankle pumps every hour. | [View Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11201858/) |
| **Boots (Normatec)** | Pneumatic compression mimics muscle pump. | "Pneumatic compression boots mimic your natural muscle pump to accelerate recovery." | "Do you enjoy using tech gadgets for recovery?<br>Do you have time to sit for 20-30 mins?" | **Add to Evening Protocol:**<br>20 mins Boots (Post-workout or long standing days). | [View Product](https://hyperice.com/get-normatec/) |
| **Rebounding (Mini-Trampoline)** | Vertical acceleration/deceleration boosts the muscle/venous-lymph pump. **Scientific Reports (2025)** showed thoracic duct diameter significantly expands with exercise load (2.69 → 3.41 mm); a **NIH-indexed IJERPH 2022 trial** used 15 mins of mini-trampoline bouncing pre-dive and saw fewer vascular gas emboli (better fluid clearance/endothelial function). | "Research shows exercise literally widens the thoracic duct to push more lymph, and a mini-trampoline trial cut post-dive microbubbles—so even gentle bouncing helps move fluid." | "Do you have joint issues that prevent jumping?<br>Could you fit a 2-minute gentle bounce into your morning?" | **Add to Morning Protocol:**<br>2-5 mins "Health Bounce" (gentle, feet on mat).<br>Drink water before/after. | [Thoracic duct flow w/ exercise (Sci Rep 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40275043/)<br>[Mini-trampoline preconditioning (IJERPH 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35564805/) |
| **Dry Brushing** | Exfoliates skin, stimulates surface capillaries. | "While deep lymph evidence is limited, dry brushing effectively stimulates surface circulation." | "Do you have sensitive skin?<br>Would you like a quick 2-minute skin routine?" | **Add to Morning Protocol:**<br>2 mins Dry Brushing (before shower). | [View Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YnVb9Ie-r0) |
