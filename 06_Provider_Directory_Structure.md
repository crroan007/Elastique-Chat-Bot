## Bot Logic for Matching
1.  **Trigger:** User provides City/State or ZIP AND expresses interest in in-person help.
2.  **Query:** Search the table for matches in the provided City or ZIP.
3.  **Output:**
    *   "I found [Provider Name] in [City]. They specialize in [Modalities]."
    *   "Would you like me to open their booking calendar?"
4.  **Safety:** Always add: *"Please verify their credentials to ensure they fit your specific medical needs."*
