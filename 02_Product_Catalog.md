## 1. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (ASK BEFORE RECOMMENDING)

Before jumping to product recommendations, **ask qualifying questions** like a real consultant:

**For Cellulite/Skin Texture:**
- "Is the cellulite mainly on your thighs, or do you notice it on your arms too?"
- "Are you more concerned about texture or fluid retention?"

**For Heavy Legs/Swelling:**
- "Does the swelling happen after standing all day, or do you notice it even in the morning?"
- "Are you traveling soon, or is this more of a daily concern?"

**For Bloating:**
- "Is the bloating constant, or does it come and go with your cycle?"
- "Do you notice it more after eating certain foods, or is it random?"

**For Workout Recovery:**
- "What type of workouts do you do—strength training, running, or both?"
- "Are you dealing with soreness, or more general fatigue?"

## 2. PRODUCT SOLUTION SCRIPTS (STEP 3 ONLY)

### CELLULITE / SKIN TEXTURE
*   **Step 3 (The Solution):** **Elastique MicroPerle® Leggings** feature tiny silicone beads that provide a passive micromassage as you move, stimulating those superficial capillaries to smooth skin texture. Research shows 56% improvement after 3 months of consistent wear.
*   **Shop:** [L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings) | [Adorn Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/adorn-leggings)

### HEAVY LEGS / SWELLING
*   **Step 3 (The Solution):** **L'Original Leggings** provide medical-grade graduated compression (tightest at the ankle) to physically oppose that filtration and boost upward flow.
*   **Shop:** [L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings) | [L'Original Stirrup](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-stirrup-leggings) (for foot compression)

### BLOATING / CORE SUPPORT
*   **Step 3 (The Solution):** The **Adorn Bodysuit** provides gentle core compression to support your posture and encourage that deep belly breathing you need for lymphatic flow.
*   **Shop:** [Adorn Bodysuit](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/adorn-bodysuit) | [Riviera Bodysuit](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/riviera-bodysuit)

### TRAVEL FATIGUE / FLYING
*   **Step 3 (The Solution):** **L'Original Leggings** or **Stirrup Leggings** are essential for travel because the graduated compression acts as a passive pump, preventing that fluid accumulation even when you're sitting for hours.
*   **Shop:** [L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings) | [L'Original Stirrup](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-stirrup-leggings)

### WORKOUT RECOVERY
*   **Step 3 (The Solution):** The **Iconic Collection** uses performance fabric to wick sweat while providing the compression needed to flush metabolic waste faster.
*   **Shop:** [Iconic 3/4 Sleeve Top](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/iconic-top) | [Iconic Tank](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/iconic-tank)

### POSTPARTUM SWELLING
*   **Step 3 (The Solution):** **Lisse Leggings** offer gentle graduated compression (no beads) that's perfect for postpartum—comfortable enough for daily wear while still providing the 18-21 mmHg compression clinically shown to reduce swelling.
*   **Shop:** [Lisse Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/lisse-leggings) | [Lisse Bike Short](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/lisse-7-5-bike-short)

### VARICOSE VEINS
*   **Step 3 (The Solution):** **L'Original Leggings** combine compression with MicroPerle® to address both the pressure (varicose veins) and the stagnation (fluid pooling).
*   **Shop:** [L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings)
