## 1. Cellulite & Skin Texture
**Science & Insights**
It is fascinating to note that cellulite is often just stagnant fluid trapped in the superficial layers. A clinical study published in *PubMed* showed a **56% reduction in skin irregularity** after just 3 months of consistent micromassage.
*(Link: [View Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11201858/))*

**Recommended Solutions**
To apply this science to your daily life, we have two excellent options:
*   **[L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings)** - Our flagship design. The patented MicroPerle® texture acts like a daily lymphatic massage to smooth skin texture while you wear them.
*   **[The Adorn Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/adorn-leggings)** - The same powerful technology but with elegant scalloped details for a more elevated look.

**Your Daily Protocol**
*   **Morning:** Dry brush for 2 minutes before your shower to stimulate surface flow.
*   **Day:** Wear your MicroPerle® leggings for at least 30-60 minutes (or all day!). The beads work best with movement.
