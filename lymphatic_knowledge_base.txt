### Lymphatic Physiology & Basics

**Question:** What is the lymphatic system and how does it work?
**Answer:**
The lymphatic system is a specialized organ system often described as the body's "sewerage system" or "secondary circulation." Unlike the heart-driven vascular system, it is a low-pressure network that relies on external forces to move fluid.

**Key Functions:**
1.  **Fluid Balance:** It collects interstitial fluid (fluid between cells), macromolecules, and waste products that leak from blood capillaries.
2.  **Immune Defense:** It transports immune cells to lymph nodes where they detect and fight infections.
3.  **Fat Absorption:** "Lacteals" in the gut absorb dietary fats and transport them to the bloodstream.

**How Lymph Moves:**
Since it has no pump like the heart, lymph flow depends on:
*   **Muscle Pump:** Contraction of skeletal muscles (like calves during walking) squeezes vessels.
*   **Respiration:** Deep breathing changes pressure in the chest, pulling lymph upwards.
*   **Arterial Pulsation:** The pulse of nearby arteries helps massage lymph vessels.
*   **Intrinsic Contractions:** Lymph vessels have tiny muscular units called "lymphangions" that contract rhythmically.

### Edema & Bloating

**Question:** What causes bloating and edema?
**Answer:**
"Bloating" is often a colloquial term for **Edema**—the excessive accumulation of interstitial fluid.

**Physiological Causes (Starling Forces):**
Edema happens when the "filtration" of fluid out of blood vessels exceeds the "drainage" capacity of the lymphatic system. This can be caused by:
1.  **Increased Pressure:** High blood pressure in capillaries forces more fluid out.
2.  **Reduced Drainage:** Blocked or sluggish lymph vessels can't clear the fluid fast enough.
3.  **Inflammation:** Makes capillary walls "leaky," letting more fluid and proteins escape into tissues.

**Common Triggers:**
*   **Sedentary Behavior:** Lack of muscle movement slows lymph flow.
*   **Hormonal Changes:** Can increase fluid retention.
*   **Diet:** High sodium or inflammatory foods.
*   **Travel:** Prolonged sitting + low cabin pressure (flying) impairs the calf muscle pump.

### Compression Therapy Science

**Question:** How does compression help with lymphatic health and swelling?
**Answer:**
Compression therapy is not just about "squeezing." It works via specific physiological mechanisms:

1.  **Reduces Filtration:** External pressure opposes the internal pressure in blood capillaries, preventing fluid from leaking out in the first place.
2.  **Enhances Re-absorption:** It helps push interstitial fluid back into the venous and lymphatic systems.
3.  **Improves Muscle Pump:** It provides a firm "wall" for muscles to push against, making every movement more effective at pumping fluid upwards.
4.  **Reduces Reflux:** Helps close valves in veins and lymph vessels to prevent backflow.

**Elastique's Approach:**
We use **Graduated Compression** (tighter at the ankle, looser moving up) which aligns with the body's natural need to push fluid against gravity back towards the heart.

### MicroPerle & Proprioception

**Question:** What is MicroPerle technology and how does it help?
**Answer:**
MicroPerle® is our signature technology that embeds tiny, strategically placed beads into the fabric. It provides two main benefits:

1.  **Micromassage:** As you move, the beads create a gentle, continuous massage effect on the skin. This stimulates the superficial lymphatic capillaries (which sit just under the skin), encouraging fluid uptake and flow.
2.  **Proprioceptive Input:** The sensation of the beads against the skin heightens **Proprioception** (your body's sense of position and movement).
    *   *Why this matters:* Enhanced proprioception improves posture and muscle engagement. Better muscle engagement means a more effective "muscle pump" to drive lymph flow. It's like a "guide" for your body to move more efficiently.

### Gut-Lymph Axis

**Question:** How is gut health connected to the lymphatic system?
**Answer:**
The gut and lymph are intimately linked through the **Gut-Lymph Axis**.

1.  **Lacteals:** These are specialized lymph vessels in the intestines responsible for absorbing dietary fats (chylomicrons).
2.  **Immune Trafficking:** The gut houses a huge portion of the body's immune system (GALT). The lymphatic system traffics immune cells from the gut to the rest of the body.
3.  **Dysbiosis & Inflammation:** Poor gut health (imbalanced microbiome) can lead to "leaky gut," allowing toxins to enter the lymph. This increases the "lymphatic load," burdening the system and potentially causing systemic inflammation or brain fog.

**Tip:** A fiber-rich diet and hydration support both gut motility and lymphatic drainage.

### Autophagy & Detox

**Question:** What is autophagy and how does it relate to detox?
**Answer:**
**Autophagy** (literally "self-eating") is the body's cellular housekeeping process. It cleans out damaged cells, proteins, and toxins to regenerate newer, healthier ones.

**Connection to Lymph:**
*   The lymphatic system is the exit route for the waste products generated during autophagy.
*   If lymph flow is stagnant, cellular waste accumulates, hindering the benefits of autophagy.
*   **Blueberries & Polyphenols:** Certain foods like blueberries are shown to support both autophagy and brain lymphatics (glymphatics), helping to "detox" the brain of metabolic waste.

### Practical Tips & Routines

**Question:** What is a good daily routine for lymphatic health?
**Answer:**
To support your lymphatic system daily, think of the "Big 4": **Movement, Hydration, Breath, and Compression.**

**Daily Protocol:**
1.  **Morning:** Start with a big glass of water. Do 10 "calf raises" (lifting heels off the ground) while brushing your teeth to wake up the leg pumps.
2.  **Movement Snacks:** If you sit at a desk, set a timer for every 60 minutes. Stand up, stretch, or do a few squats.
3.  **Deep Breathing:** Take 5 deep "belly breaths" (diaphragmatic breathing). The pressure change in your abdomen acts like a vacuum to pull lymph up from the legs.
4.  **Wear Compression:** Especially on busy days, travel days, or days with lots of standing/sitting. Elastique garments provide that passive support all day.
5.  **Legs Up:** End the day with "Legs Up the Wall" pose for 10-15 minutes to let gravity drain the fluid.

**Question:** How does cold exposure help?
**Answer:**
Brief cold exposure (like a cold shower finish) causes **Vasoconstriction** (blood vessels tighten), followed by a rebound dilation. This "pumping" action of the vessels (vasomotion) can help stimulate fluid movement. However, avoid extreme cold if you have an acute injury or compromised circulation.
