# Protocol Templates & Logic

## 1. Daily Protocol Structure
Every daily protocol generated must follow this chronological flow. **Adjust intensity based on user answers to Driver Questions.**

### **Morning: Activation**
*   **Goal:** Jumpstart the lymphatic pump after sleep.
*   **Hydration:** Drink 1 large glass of water (optional: with lemon/electrolytes).
*   **Movement:** 2-5 minutes of Rebounding ("Health Bounce" with feet on mat) or brisk walk. Even 2 minutes flushes the system.
*   **Breathing:** 5-10 rounds of deep diaphragmatic breathing.
*   **Optional:** Dry brushing (before shower) or cold rinse (end of shower).

### **Midday: Maintenance**
*   **Goal:** Counteract gravity and stagnation (especially for desk jobs).
*   **Movement:** "Movement snacks" every 60-90 minutes. Stand up, calf raises, or a short walk.
*   **Compression:** If sitting/standing for long periods, wear compression garments (Elastique).
*   **Hydration:** Continue steady water intake.

### **Afternoon: Flow**
*   **Goal:** Prevent the "afternoon slump" and fluid pooling.
*   **Movement:** 10-15 minute walk or light stretching.
*   **Breathing:** 2-3 minutes of focused breathing to reset the nervous system.
*   **Nutrition:** Focus on anti-inflammatory foods (avoid high sodium/processed sugar).

### **Evening: Release**
*   **Goal:** Drain accumulated fluid and prepare for rest.
*   **Movement:** Legs Up the Wall (Viparita Karani) for 10-15 minutes.
*   **Manual:** Gentle abdominal massage or self-MLD (if known).
*   **Compression:** Remove compression garments.

### **Bedtime: Restoration**
*   **Goal:** Optimize glymphatic (brain) clearance.
*   **Environment:** Cool, dark room.
*   **Breathing:** Slow, calming breathwork (e.g., 4-7-8 technique).
*   **Sleep Position:** Side sleeping is often recommended for glymphatic flow (check comfort).

## 2. Weekly Protocol Structure
A balanced week should include:

*   **Daily:** Breathing + Hydration (Non-negotiable).
*   **3-4 Days:** Structured Exercise (e.g., 30+ min of Zone 2 cardio, resistance training, or yoga/pilates).
*   **High Static Days:** Wear compression on days with 4+ hours of sitting/standing.
*   **2-4 Days:** Optional Dry Brushing (best before showers).
*   **Optional:** 1 In-person Lymphatic Session (if user desires/budget allows).

## 3. Personalization Logic (Linked to Driver Questions)
Adjust the above templates based on these factors:

*   **Sedentary/Desk Job:** Emphasize Midday movement snacks + Compression.
*   **Active/Athlete:** Emphasize recovery, magnesium, and post-workout compression.
*   **Postpartum:** Focus on gentle core reconnection, diaphragmatic breathing, and pelvic floor safe movements.
*   **Travel:** High compression focus during travel, extra hydration, frequent movement breaks.
*   **Swelling/Heaviness:** Increase frequency of "Legs Up the Wall" and compression use.
*   **Time Constraint ("I have 5 mins"):**
    *   *Protocol:* 10 Deep Breaths + 50 Heel Drops + 1 Glass of Water.

## 4. Rescheduling & Flexibility
*   **Missed Routine:** "No worries. Life happens. Let's just do 5 minutes of breathing now and get back on track tomorrow."
*   **Too Tired:** "Listen to your body. Skip the workout, just do 'Legs Up the Wall' for 10 mins to help your system drain without effort."
