## SCENARIO 1: CELLULITE / SKIN TEXTURE

### Products That Help (6 options):
- L'Original Leggings
- L'Original Bike Short
- L'Original Flowy Short
- Adorn Leggings
- The Fierce Leggings
- Le Monde Leggings

### Initial Response Script:

**Step 1 - Science:**
"Cellulite forms when lymphatic fluid gets trapped in superficial tissue, causing fibrosis. **Research shows:** Micromassage studies found 56% reduction in dermis-hypodermis surface irregularity after 3 months of consistent wear."

**Step 2 - Behavior:**
"Movement and hydration help flush this fluid naturally—try dry brushing or gentle massage daily."

**Step 3 - Present Overlap:**
"Great news! Several of our collections use MicroPerle® technology for this exact issue. Let me help you find the perfect fit."

### Discovery Questions:

**Q1: "What's your primary use?"**
- "Everyday wear" → Adorn Leggings (elegant) or L'Original (versatile)
- "Workouts/training" → Iconic or L'Original Flowy Short
- "Travel" → L'Original Leggings or Stirrup
- "Bold style/leopard print" → The Fierce Leggings

**Q2: "Do you prefer full-length leggings or shorts?"**
- "Full-length" → L'Original, Adorn, Fierce, or Le Monde
- "Shorts/bike shorts" → L'Original Bike Short or Flowy Short

**Q3: "What's your budget comfort level?"**
- "Investment piece" → L'Original Leggings ($235)
- "Mid-range" → Adorn Leggings
- "Shorts option" → L'Original Bike Short ($185)

### Final Recommendation Script:

**Example Response:**
"Based on your answers, I'd recommend these two options:

1. **[L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings)** ($235) - Our flagship. Maximum lymphatic drainage, works beautifully for travel, workouts, and daily wear. The gold standard.

2. **[Adorn Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/adorn-leggings)** - Elegant scalloped details with the same MicroPerle® technology. Perfect if you want something that feels a bit more elevated for everyday.

Both use the same micromassage research. Which fits your lifestyle better?"

## SCENARIO 2: SWELLING / HEAVY LEGS

### Products That Help (4 options):
- L'Original Leggings (MicroPerle® + Compression)
- L'Original Stirrup (MicroPerle® + Foot compression)
- Lisse Leggings (Compression only, gentle)
- L'Original Bike Short (Summer option)

### Initial Response Script:

**Step 1 - Science:**
"Heavy legs happen when gravity wins—fluid pools in your lower limbs because filtration is faster than drainage. **Research shows:** A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs found that compression between 15-20 mmHg significantly reduces leg edema and improves venous return."

**Step 2 - Behavior:**
"Elevating your legs (Legs Up the Wall) and doing calf raises activates the 'muscle pump' to push fluid back up."

**Step 3 - Present Overlap:**
"We have several options with graduated compression to address this. Let me find the best one for you."

### Discovery Questions:

**Q1: "When is the swelling worst?"**
- "After standing all day" → L'Original Leggings (all-day wear)
- "During/after flights or long car rides" → L'Original Stirrup (foot compression prevents pooling)
- "Throughout the day, even morning" → May need medical evaluation, but Lisse Leggings (gentle compression)

**Q2: "Are you postpartum or dealing with hormonal changes?"**
- "Yes, postpartum" → Lisse Leggings (gentle 18-21 mmHg, research-backed for postpartum)
- "Hormonal/menstrual cycle" → L'Original Leggings

**Q3: "Preference on length?"**
- "Full-length leggings" → L'Original or Lisse
- "Bike shorts (summer)" → L'Original Bike Short

### Final Recommendation Script:

**Example Response:**
"For your situation, I'd suggest:

1. **[L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings)** - Medical-grade compression (8-13 mmHg, tightest at ankle) + MicroPerle® beads. Best all-around option for daily swelling.

2. **[Lisse Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/lisse-leggings)** - Compression only (no beads), gentle enough for postpartum. Clinical trials show 18-21 mmHg reduces postpartum swelling significantly.

The L'Original gives you the dual benefit of compression + micromassage. The Lisse is gentler and budget-friendly. Which sounds like a better fit?"

## SCENARIO 3: TRAVEL / FLYING

### Products That Help (3 options):
- L'Original Stirrup (BEST for flights - foot compression)
- L'Original Leggings (Versatile travel)
- L'Original Bike Short (Warm climates)

### Initial Response Script:

**Step 1 - Science:**
"Pressurized cabins and sitting still cause 'Economy Class Syndrome'—fluid pools rapidly because your muscle pump is inactive. **Research shows:** A flight attendant study found that 8-15 mmHg compression reduced leg swelling and discomfort by 50% during prolonged sitting."

**Step 2 - Behavior:**
"Get up every hour, do ankle pumps in your seat, and drink electrolytes to stay hydrated."

**Step 3 - Present Overlap:**
"For travel, we have specific options designed for this."

### Discovery Questions:

**Q1: "How long are your typical flights?"**
- "Short (1-3 hours)" → L'Original Leggings (sufficient)
- "Long-haul (5+ hours)" → L'Original Stirrup (foot compression critical)

**Q2: "Traveling to warm or cold climate?"**
- "Warm/tropical" → L'Original Bike Short
- "Cold/temperate" → L'Original Leggings or Stirrup

**Q3: "Do you have any foot swelling issues?"**
- "Yes, ankles/feet swell" → L'Original Stirrup (anchors compression to prevent foot pooling)
- "No, just legs" → L'Original Leggings

### Final Recommendation Script:

**Example Response:**
"For long flights, I strongly recommend:

1. **[L'Original Stirrup Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-stirrup-leggings)** ($275) - THE travel legging. The stirrup design anchors compression all the way to your feet, preventing that ankle swelling you get on planes.

2. **[L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings)** ($235) - Great for shorter trips or if you don't typically get foot swelling.

The Stirrup is our #1 recommendation for frequent flyers. Sound good?"

## SCENARIO 4: WORKOUTS / ARM COMPRESSION

### Products That Help (3 options):
- Iconic 3/4 Sleeve Top (Arm compression + built-in bra)
- Iconic Tank (Built-in bra, torso compression)
- L'Original Tank (Hip-length, medium support)

### Initial Response Script:

**Step 1 - Science:**
"Compression during workouts reduces metabolic waste buildup and improves circulation. **Research shows:** Compression therapy reduces arm fatigue and swelling, while micromassage promotes lymphatic flow during activity."

**Step 2 - Behavior:**
"Stay hydrated and do post-workout stretching to activate lymph flow."

**Step 3 - Present Overlap:**
"We have tops with built-in bras designed specifically for active wear."

### Discovery Questions:

**Q1: "What type of workouts?"**
- "High-intensity/HIIT" → Iconic 3/4 Sleeve (maximum support)
- "Yoga/Pilates/low-impact" → Iconic Tank or L'Original Tank

**Q2: "Do you want arm compression?"**
- "Yes, arms feel tired/heavy" → Iconic 3/4 Sleeve Top
- "No, just torso" → Iconic Tank

**Q3: "Bra support level?"**
- "Maximum support" → Iconic 3/4 Sleeve
- "Medium support" → L'Original Tank

### Final Recommendation Script:

**Example Response:**
"For your workouts, I'd suggest:

1. **[Iconic 3/4 Sleeve MicroPerle Top](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/iconic-top)** - Built-in bra, arm compression to prevent fatigue, lymphatic drainage. Perfect for HIIT or strength training.

2. **[Iconic MicroPerle Tank](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/iconic-tank)** - Built-in bra, torso compression. Great for yoga or lower-intensity workouts.

The sleeve gives you arm support if you're lifting or doing intense cardio. Which matches your workout style?"

### Products That Help (3 options):
- Adorn Bodysuit (MicroPerle® + core compression)
- Riviera Bodysuit (Swim-friendly)
- Le Cha-Cha Jumpsuit (All-in-one elegance)

### Initial Response Script:

**Step 1 - Science:**
"Core compression supports your posture and encourages diaphragmatic breathing, which creates a vacuum effect to pull lymph up from your gut and legs."

**Step 2 - Behavior:**
"Practice belly breathing daily—it empties the Cisterna Chyli (your body's 'drain plug')."

**Step 3 - Present Overlap:**
"Our bodysuits provide gentle core compression for this exact purpose."

### Discovery Questions:

**Q1: "Primary use?"**
- "Everyday wear/work" → Adorn Bodysuit

1. **[Adorn Bodysuit](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/adorn-bodysuit)** ($250) - MicroPerle® + core compression. High support, versatile for daily wear, swim, or workouts. Tummy control + lymphatic drainage.

### Products That Help (2 options):
- Lisse Leggings (Gentle compression, research-backed)
- L'Original Leggings (More support, if cleared by doctor)

### Initial Response Script:

**Step 1 - Science:**
"Postpartum swelling is super common as your body adjusts. **Research shows:** Clinical trials demonstrate that 18-21 mmHg compression reduces postpartum leg swelling significantly."

**Step 2 - Behavior:**
"Elevate your legs when resting, stay hydrated, and gentle movement (walks) helps activate your muscle pump."

**Step 3 - Present Overlap:**
"We have compression specifically tested for postpartum."

- "Yes" → Either option
- "Not yet" → Recommend medical clearance first, then Lisse

### Final Recommendation Script:

**Example Response:**
"For postpartum, I'd start with:

1. **[Lisse Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/lisse-leggings)** - Gentle graduated compression (18-21 mmHg), clinically proven for postpartum swelling. No beads, so it's super comfortable during recovery.

If you're further along and want more support:

2. **[L'Original Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/loriginal-leggings)** - Medical-grade compression + MicroPerle®. Just check with your doctor first.

## SCENARIO 7: BUDGET-CONSCIOUS CUSTOMERS

  - Lisse Leggings ($150 vs $235)
  - Lisse Bike Short ($125 vs $185)
  - Lisse Bra
  - Lisse Tank

### Script:

"I totally understand budget considerations! Our **Lisse Collection** offers the same graduated compression technology without the MicroPerle® beads, making it more accessible.

**[Lisse Leggings](https://www.elastiqueathletics.com/products/lisse-leggings)** ($150) still provide:
- Graduated compression for swelling and circulation
- Research-backed benefits (same compression studies apply)
- Perfect for daily wear, workouts, and travel
