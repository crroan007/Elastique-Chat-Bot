ELASTIQUE LYMPHATIC WELLNESS ASSISTANT MVP
Scope of Work & Services Agreement
This Scope of Work & Services Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of __________ ("Effective Date") by and between Elastique Athletics ("Client") and __________________ ("Contractor"). Collectively, the parties agree as follows:
1. Project Overview
Contractor will deliver an AI-powered conversational guide on the Elastique website that serves as the world's most informed, medically aligned, and empathetic lymphatic health assistant—always on-brand for Elastique. The assistant engages visitors in natural dialogue, educates on lymphatic health and its ties to hydration, nutrition, movement, and massage, connects user goals to Elastique's product ecosystem without referencing competitors, reinforces safety disclaimers, and defers or escalates whenever information falls outside the approved corpus.
2. Objectives
Provide a secure, ungated chat experience accessible to all Elastique website visitors.
Restrict knowledge, tone, disclaimers, referrals, and escalation logic to Elastique-supplied, medically certified materials and leadership-approved brand guidance.
Encourage positive wellness actions while naturally highlighting Elastique products.
Maintain session context within each live conversation without retaining cross-session data.
Ensure conversations can produce: (1) protocols grounded in lymphatic best practices, (2) Elastique product recommendations for lymph movement maintenance, (3) referrals via the supplied therapist library (with fuzzy matching if zip/city is missing), and/or (4) offers to schedule consultations with an Elastique Success Manager.
3. Key Features (MVP)
Approved-content-driven flows covering lymphatic fundamentals, hydration, nutrition, movement, massage, and garment compression benefits.
Brand personality co-developed with CEO, COO, and Head of Marketing, enforced via guardrails embedding Elastique-provided disclaimers, escalation scripts, and competitor filters.
Session-scoped memory for contextual personalization.
Native analytics (conversation totals, contact capture/completion, attribution tags, sentiment flags) in the standard reporting dashboard.
Revenue attribution tagging via native tags.
Referral logic using Elastique's therapist directory with fuzzy fallback plus scripted Success Manager consultation offers.
4. Deliverables (Two-Week Sprint; Sequential Execution)
4.1 Discovery & Design
Conversation framework, empathy cues, referral/consultation logic, escalation triggers, tone/personality guide, and content dataset specification (documents, disclaimers, therapist directory, Success Manager scripts, sourcing notes, refresh cadence).
4.2 Development
Branded chat UX on the Elastique website; AI orchestration service consuming the approved corpus, honoring session memory, performing referral lookups, and handling consultation offers; guardrail implementation for disclaimers/ escalations/competitor filtering/defer-to-human logic; configuration of native attribution tags.
4.3 Testing & Review
Functional, tone, referral, and guardrail testing; medical/legal validation documenting "not covered" topics; brand approval with CEO, COO, and Head of Marketing.
4.4 Deployment & Stabilization
Production launch on the Elastique website and a post-launch observation window with rapid, pre-approved copy tweaks plus a documented path for future enhancements.
5. Out-of-Scope (MVP)
Multilingual experiences or alternate personas.

10. Term & Termination
Term begins on the Effective Date and continues through completion of the MVP sprint, including the post-launch observation window, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement.
Either party may terminate for material breach if such breach remains uncured for ten (10) days after written notice.
Upon termination, Client shall pay Contractor for all work performed and expenses incurred through the termination date, including any non-cancelable commitments.
11. Confidentiality & Intellectual Property
